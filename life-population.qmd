title: "Life Expectancy and Population"

## Analysis

We'll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between population size and life expectancy.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

# Filter the dataset to the most recent year available
latest_data <- gapminder[gapminder$year == max(gapminder$year),]

# Create scatter plot
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale for population
  labs(
    title = "Life Expectancy vs Population",
    x = "Population (Log Scale)",
    y = "Life Expectancy (years)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

  ```
